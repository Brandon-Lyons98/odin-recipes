            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until browned and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken and set aside on a plate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add heavy cream, chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning to the skillet. Whisk sauce over medium-high heat until starting to thicken, about 5 minutes.
